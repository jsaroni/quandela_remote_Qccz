# quandela_remote_Qccz
By comparing the performances and fidelities of the Ralph CNOT, Knill CZ, Post-processed CNOT, and KLM CNOT gates, we found that the KLM CNOT gate has 100% fidelity as all the other gates and it's performance is higher than that of the Knill CZ (2/27) but lower than the Ralph CNOT and Post-processed CNOT (1/9). However it is possible to increase this performance through resource reduction (References from https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1018839108). We used the KLM CNOT gates in the decomposed CCZ gate. For the bonus part we manually input a gate that corresponds to the product of two CZ gates to directly implement them.
